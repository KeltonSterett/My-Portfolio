# Kelton Steretts Portfolio Project

## Description
1. In this project we were to make our very own portfolio web app from scratch using HTML and CSS.
2. I started by creating HTML and CSS files in my VScode
3. I then began to work on the content of my web app by applying my knowledge of HTNL to create the headers, body and other sections of my web app.
4. After that I began to style my web site using my CSS style sheet and linking it to my HTML.
5. I added working jump links and pictures with links that will open a new browser to view my selected links in.
6. I put the final touches and what for now is my portfolio ( I Think its ugly right now will change that later on but should meet the acceptance criteria for this project)
7. i finished by putting my final css touches and organizing my code a little bettter to make it more readable.
